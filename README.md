Chloroform
==========

> Does this rag smells like chloroform?

A customizable contact form app. Chloroform proposes a configuration model for
a contact form. A contact form is defined by a `Configuration` object which
links a set of `Metadata` through `Requirement` objects. `Metadata` define
fields for the contact form. They define the field type, name, and description.
`Requirement` link the configuration and the metadata and define if the field
is required. `Metadata` instances can be shared by multiple configuration.

The form is generated by Chloroform according to the configuration. Chloroform
has a `default` configuration. The form is generated by a view or by a template tag.
